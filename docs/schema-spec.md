# CRM Schema Spec v4.2

**Status:** Current

This document is the canonical current-state schema reference for the vault and logic layer.

Some current templates still include calculated or compatibility fields for operational continuity. In this document, the field status is normative: `Calculated` and `Deprecated` fields should be treated as non-canonical even if they still appear in templates today.

For the end-to-end lead-to-opportunity lifecycle model, see `docs/crm-journey-spec.md`.

## Field Status

- `Canonical`: part of the intended durable schema and should be used for new writes.
- `Calculated`: derived by automation. If persisted, treat as a cache or telemetry output rather than source-of-truth.
- `Compatibility`: still written or tolerated to preserve older workflows.
- `Deprecated`: should not be used for new writes and should be removed once migration risk is low.

## Global Rules

- Dates use `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Wikilinks in frontmatter should be quoted.
- Flat frontmatter is canonical. Do not introduce nested YAML objects.
- `source` and `source-ref` are provenance fields and should be preserved when known.
- `owner` is canonical even in the single-operator model.
- The vault is relationship-first. Execution and finance records extend that model, they do not replace it.

## Entity Paths

- `Organizations/`
- `Accounts/`
- `Contacts/`
- `Leads/`
- `Opportunities/`
- `Engagements/`
- `Workstreams/`
- `Source-Artifacts/`
- `Invoices/`
- `Payments/`
- `Retainers/`
- `Activities/`
- `Notes/`
- `Tasks/`
- `Inbox/`
- `Deal-Flow/`

Note: the conceptual entity is `Deal`. The repo is still in a path transition between `Deal-Flow/` and a future `Deals/` canonical directory.

## Commercial And Execution Boundaries

- `Opportunity` is the pre-close pursuit record.
- A real commercial commitment, including a pilot, becomes an `Engagement`.
- `Engagement` is the post-close commercial and execution container.
- `Workstream` is a generalized execution lane within an engagement.
- Every `Workstream` must belong to exactly one `Engagement`.
- Significant unpaid or ambiguous pre-close effort remains represented through `Activities`, `Notes`, `Tasks`, and relationship heat inside the opportunity layer.
- `Notes` remain the durable knowledge object. Do not add a separate first-class `Insight` entity unless future workflows prove `Notes` are overloaded.
- `Source Artifact` is the canonical reference to an external artifact. `Note` is the durable interpreted memory derived from that artifact.

## Calculated Signals Summary

These are currently used by the dashboard and intelligence layers, but they are not core business truth:

- `warmth-score`
- `warmth-status`
- `velocity-score`
- `account-warmth-index`
- `days-since-contact`

`last-contacted` is different: it is an observed persisted signal and remains canonical.

## Highest Priority Future Cleanup

1. Remove `deal-value` once all readers rely only on `commercial-value`.
2. Stop writing calculated fields into templates where they are not needed as caches.
3. Remove legacy aliases such as `full--name`, `activity-date`, `stage` on Accounts, and old ad hoc Opportunity fields.
4. `Deliverable` remains deferred in the current implementation wave. Revisit it only after engagement, workstream, finance, and source-artifact workflows are stable in real operator use.
5. Complete `Deal-Flow/` to `Deals/` path normalization.
