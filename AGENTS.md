# Agent Context: CRM Logic

## Purpose

This repo is the logic layer for a private AI-first personal CRM.

The source of truth is the markdown vault at `CRM_DATA_PATH`, not this repo itself. This repo contains:
- templates for canonical record creation
- scripts that read, write, and synthesize the vault
- agent skill instructions for operational workflows
- examples and schema docs for onboarding and maintenance

The system is optimized for one principal operator doing relationship-led advisory, consulting, fundraising, brokerage, and related operator work.

## Start Here

If you are new to the project, read in this order:

1. `docs/schema-spec.md`
2. `README.md`
3. `crm-data/DASHBOARD.md`
4. `crm-data/RELATIONSHIP_MEMORY.md`
5. `crm-data/INTELLIGENCE.md`

Then inspect the relevant `Organization`, `Account`, `Contact`, and `Opportunity` records for the relationship you are working on.

Before implementing or changing any mutation workflow, also read:

6. `crm-data/index.md` if it exists
7. `crm-data/log.md` if it exists

Then internalize these current repo realities before making changes:
- `crm-daily-processing` is the preferred top-level daily operating loop
- `crm-data/index.md` and `crm-data/log.md` are part of the write contract, not optional extras
- `Deal-Flow/` is still the live deal inventory path
- `waiting` is a first-class task state and should be treated as reminder-driven review, not execution failure
- a startup may legitimately appear in both `Deal-Flow/` and `Opportunities/`, but those records serve different purposes
- Workspace ingest now has additive Google Drive plus optional Granola and WhatsApp post-passes after the main Gmail / Calendar flow

## Core Mental Model

Think in two layers:

- `crm-logic/`
  - public-friendly logic, templates, scripts, and skills
- `crm-data/`
  - private vault and operational system of record

This is a local-first, markdown-native, git-auditable memory system. Trust matters more than automation volume.

## Environment

Always resolve `CRM_DATA_PATH` dynamically from `.env` or the environment.

Typical local setup:

```text
CRM_DATA_PATH=./crm-data
```

Do not assume:
- the vault is checked into the main repo
- the vault is fully normalized
- all records follow the latest templates perfectly
- every write should be committed automatically

## Current Canonical Entity Model

The canonical schema is in `docs/schema-spec.md`. Use that file as the source of truth for fields and status labels.

### Organizations
- Stable market entities
- Own identity, classification, investor profile fields, and observed signals such as `last-contacted`

### Accounts
- Commercial relationship wrappers around `Organizations`
- Own relationship lifecycle and `strategic-importance`

### Contacts
- Durable person records
- Usually link to an `Account`, and optionally to a `Deal`

### Leads
- Pre-conversion records
- Default conversion path:
  - `Lead -> Organization + Contact + Account + Opportunity`

### Opportunities
- Concrete pre-close commercial pursuits
- This is the operational center of gravity while work is still pre-close
- Often represents John's potential mandate with a company or founder

### Engagements
- Post-close commercial and execution containers
- Created when work is commercially won, including pilots
- Can own multiple parallel `Workstreams`

### Workstreams
- Execution lanes within an `Engagement`
- General enough for advisory, research, implementation, marketing, board-support, and related delivery work
- Must always belong to an `Engagement`

### Deals
- Fundraising inventory objects
- Still stored under `Deal-Flow/` in the current vault, even though the conceptual entity name is `Deal`
- Represents a company John may shop to investors even if there is no paid mandate yet

### Notes
- Durable strategic or contextual memory
- Not raw intake
- Still the primary durable knowledge object even as delivery and research expand

### Source Artifacts
- Canonical references to external evidence and documents
- Used for Google Drive, Readwise, Granola, URLs, local files, and future external systems
- `Notes` should capture durable interpretation derived from them

### Finance Records
- `Retainers`, `Invoices`, and `Payments` extend the post-close commercial model
- These are lightweight CRM-side commercial tracking records, not a full accounting system

### Activities
- Real events or interactions
- Emails, meetings, calls, analysis, and other event records

### Tasks
- Explicit next actions

### Inbox
- Temporary raw capture
- Should usually be processed into durable records and then cleared

## Canonical vs Calculated vs Deprecated

`docs/schema-spec.md` explicitly marks:
- `Canonical`
- `Calculated`
- `Compatibility`
- `Deprecated`

Follow those labels.

Important practical rules:
- Prefer canonical fields for all new writes
- Do not add deprecated fields to new records
- Calculated fields are telemetry or cache, not business truth
- Compatibility fields may still exist in live vault data and must be tolerated by readers

## What Is Canonical Right Now

### Account model
- `Organization` is first-class
- `Account` is relationship-layer, not identity-layer
- New Account writes should not include old identity fields like `company-name`, `type`, `industry`, `size`, `investment-mandate`, or `check-size`

### Opportunity model
- `commercial-value` is canonical
- `deal-value` is compatibility-only
- `organization` is canonical on opportunities
- `opportunity-type` is canonical
- Investor mandate and check-size do not belong on opportunities
- Deal fundraising fields do not belong on opportunities

### Deal vs Opportunity interpretation
- `Deal` answers: "is this company in inventory and matchable to investors?"
- `Opportunity` answers: "is there a possible or real commercial mandate for John here?"
- It is correct to keep a company in `Deal-Flow/` while leaving the related `Opportunity` in `discovery`
- Do not collapse the two just because both involve the same startup

### Opportunity vs Engagement vs Workstream interpretation
- `Opportunity` answers: "should this work be won?"
- `Engagement` answers: "what commercially won work now exists?"
- `Workstream` answers: "what execution lane exists inside that engagement?"
- Significant pre-close effort should remain on the opportunity unless a real commercial commitment exists
- A `Workstream` must never exist without an `Engagement`

### Contact model
- `full-name` is canonical
- `full--name` is legacy-only

### Path reality
- `Deal-Flow/` is still the live deal path in the vault
- Readers should tolerate legacy path and field shapes

## Current Vault Reality

The vault has already gone through a structural cleanup. Current state:

- Non-commercial legacy Account shims were removed after references were migrated to `Organizations`
- Commercial accounts with linked opportunities remain under `Accounts/`
- Opportunities were normalized to a stricter flat current shape
- `docs/schema-spec.md` is the only schema source in `docs/`
- Old docs were moved into `docs/archive/`

Still expect:
- older frontmatter in some records
- generated files in `crm-data/staging/`
- telemetry fields written by intelligence scripts
- occasional need for compatibility handling in readers

## Relationship Model

The memory system is assembled from:
- `Organizations`
- `Accounts`
- `Contacts`
- `Opportunities`
- `Engagements`
- `Workstreams`
- `Leads`
- `Deals`
- `Notes`
- `Source Artifacts`
- `Retainers`
- `Invoices`
- `Payments`
- `Activities`
- `Tasks`
- Workspace-derived telemetry

When active relationship work exists, new `Notes` and `Activities` should usually attach primarily to the most specific active commercial or execution parent.

Preferred primary-parent precedence:
1. `Workstream`
2. `Engagement`
3. `Opportunity`
4. `Contact`
5. `Account`

For pre-close commercial execution, prefer `crm-opportunity-manager` over raw record creation commands.
For post-close commercial execution, prefer `crm-engagement-manager`.
Use lower-level create commands as sub-workflows, not the top-level operating abstraction.

## Operational Loop

The normal operator loop is:

1. Sync Workspace
2. Review staged proposals and discoveries
3. Process Inbox items
4. Create or update durable records
5. Refresh dashboard and derived views

The preferred top-level abstraction for this is the `crm-daily-processing` skill. It should also explicitly ask the user for material updates that happened outside Google Workspace or outside the CRM before considering the daily review complete.

Current day-to-day pattern:
1. Read `DASHBOARD.md`, `index.md`, and `log.md`
2. Run Workspace ingest
3. Review Drive / Granola / WhatsApp ingest outputs and apply obvious low-ambiguity changes
4. Ask the user for off-system updates from WhatsApp, calls, in-person meetings, and already-sent emails
5. Reconcile `todo`, `waiting`, and stale tasks
6. Update opportunities, leads, deals, and activities
7. Refresh dashboard / index / log

Derived outputs:
- `crm-data/DASHBOARD.md`
- `crm-data/INTELLIGENCE.md`
- `crm-data/RELATIONSHIP_MEMORY.md`
- `crm-data/staging/matches.json`
- `crm-data/index.md`
- `crm-data/log.md`

The home view is relationship-first, not timeline-first.

## Workspace Sync Rules

Workspace sync currently starts with Gmail and Calendar, then may extend into Google Drive, Granola, and WhatsApp after the main event pass.

Critical rules:
- always read Gmail body content or Calendar event details before creating an `Activity`
- use `source-ref` for dedupe
- persist checkpoint state in `crm-data/staging/workspace_sync_state.json`
- if `--since` is omitted, resume from checkpoint
- if `--since YYYY-MM-DD` is passed, treat that as an explicit backfill window
- preserve ordering: Gmail / Calendar first, then broad note lookup, then CRM-labeled Drive docs, then optional Granola enrichment, then optional WhatsApp enrichment
- Granola and WhatsApp are optional and must fail open; ingest should still succeed without them

Current ingest realities worth knowing before changing the pipeline:
- task detection is now thread-aware for Gmail and uses attachment / prior-thread context for better completion and follow-up inference
- task completion suggestions are staged again; they are no longer accidentally dropped
- meeting-note discovery is still event-centric first; CRM-labeled Drive docs are only an additive catch-up pass
- Granola post-ingest currently runs through local `codex exec` plus Granola MCP, not a Python-native Granola API client
- Granola-derived Activities and Tasks dedupe by durable `source-ref` provenance
- WhatsApp post-ingest now checks `wacli doctor --json`, runs a bounded `wacli sync --once` when no live sync is already connected, then reads the SQLite message store in read-only mode; sync failures remain fail-open and are recorded in staging
- WhatsApp checkpointing currently uses both `whatsapp_last_sync_at` and `whatsapp_last_rowid`
- the WhatsApp pass is intentionally conservative: unanchored group chatter is ignored by default and unanchored direct chats require strong business signal before staging anything

Useful ingest flags:
- `--since YYYY-MM-DD`
- `--auto-tier N`
- `--skip-granola`
- `--skip-whatsapp`

Important staging files:
- `crm-data/staging/activity_updates.json`
- `crm-data/staging/contact_discoveries.json`
- `crm-data/staging/lead_decisions.json`
- `crm-data/staging/opportunity_suggestions.json`
- `crm-data/staging/task_suggestions.json`
- `crm-data/staging/ingestion_audit.json`
- `crm-data/staging/workspace_updates.json`
- `crm-data/staging/discovery.json`
- `crm-data/staging/interactions.json`
- `crm-data/staging/drive_document_updates.json`
- `crm-data/staging/granola_updates.json`
- `crm-data/staging/whatsapp_updates.json`
- `crm-data/staging/workspace_sync_state.json`
- `crm-data/staging/matches.json`

Important settings currently recognized by ingest:
- `crm-data/settings.json` -> `crm_drive_label_ids`
- `crm-data/settings.json` -> `granola_post_ingest_enabled`
- `crm-data/settings.json` -> `granola_post_ingest_lookback_days`
- `crm-data/settings.json` -> `whatsapp_post_ingest_enabled`
- `crm-data/settings.json` -> `whatsapp_post_ingest_lookback_days`
- `crm-data/settings.json` -> `whatsapp_sync_max_db_size`
- `crm-data/settings.json` -> `whatsapp_archive_max_messages`
- `crm-data/settings.json` -> `whatsapp_account`
- `crm-data/settings.json` -> `whatsapp_store_dir`

## File Creation Rules

- Always use `templates/` for new records
- Use `YYYY-MM-DD` everywhere
- Quote wikilinks in frontmatter
- Preserve provenance fields when known
- Prefer structured frontmatter over body prose when the system depends on a field
- Treat `crm-data/index.md` as generated navigation state, not hand-authored content
- Treat `crm-data/log.md` as append-only operational history

Naming conventions:
- All CRM record filenames should be hyphen-separated slugs. Do not introduce spaces or punctuation in record filenames.
- Activities: `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`
- Tasks: `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`
- Activities, Tasks, and Notes are stored under `YYYY/MM/` subfolders inside their entity directories.

Live task semantics:
- `todo`: John owes the next move
- `waiting`: someone else owes the next move; set `due-date` to the next review date
- `completed`: done or clearly superseded
- task records may persist `google-task-id` and `google-task-list-id` when linked to Google Tasks

Google Tasks operating rule:
- the CRM remains the source of truth for task creation and task meaning
- `crm-sync-google-tasks` is a narrow sync utility for mirroring CRM tasks into Google Tasks and pulling clear remote completion back into the CRM
- do not treat Google-native personal tasks as CRM tasks unless an explicit intake workflow is introduced

## Git And Safety Rules

Be conservative.

- `crm-data` may be a nested repo, ignored directory, or ordinary subdirectory
- do not assume every write should be committed immediately
- do not use broad `git add .` in vault-related workflows unless explicitly intended
- avoid destructive mass rewrites unless the task clearly calls for them
- when changing schema-bearing data, prefer migration scripts plus validation over manual bulk edits

## Practical Rules For Agents

- Prefer empirical evidence from Workspace signals and linked records over assumption
- If an event already exists, enrich it rather than duplicating it
- If a staged Workspace proposal matches an existing Activity, attach the `source-ref` and remove the duplicate proposal
- Do not use `Notes` as raw scratch space
- Do not run `scripts/index-notes.py` unless explicitly instructed
- Improve consistency when touching a record, but do not silently rewrite unrelated data
- Read `crm-data/index.md` first when you need to locate relevant records quickly
- Use `crm-data/log.md` to understand recent mutation history before adding overlapping automation

## Navigation And Mutation Contract

`index.md` and `log.md` are part of the operational contract of the vault.

When adding or changing functionality:
- always consider whether the change introduces or alters a mutation workflow
- if the workflow creates, updates, converts, processes, archives, or otherwise mutates durable CRM records, it must also consider `index.md` and `log.md`
- new mutation workflows should update `crm-data/index.md` after successful writes
- new mutation workflows should append a structured entry to `crm-data/log.md`
- multi-record workflows should usually log once at the workflow level and rebuild `index.md` once after the workflow succeeds
- read-only workflows should not append to `log.md`
- if a change introduces a new record path convention, it must preserve the repo policy that record filenames are hyphen-separated slugs

When reviewing PRs or script changes:
- check whether any new writer path forgot to update navigation artifacts
- treat missing `index.md` refreshes or missing `log.md` appends as integration gaps, not optional polish

## Important Scripts

### Core record creation and lifecycle
- `.agents/skills/crm-lead-manager/SKILL.md`

- `scripts/account_manager.py`
- `scripts/contact_manager.py`
- `scripts/deal_manager.py`
- `scripts/task_manager.py`
- `.agents/skills/crm-lead-manager/scripts/lead_manager.py`
- `scripts/inbox_manager.py`

## Examples And Docs

Current examples:
- `examples/`

Current canonical schema doc:
- `docs/schema-spec.md`

Archived historical docs:
- `docs/archive/`

Do not treat archived docs as authoritative if they conflict with the current schema spec or current code.

## If You Need To Be Productive Quickly

For a relationship-specific task:

1. Read the relevant `Organization`, `Account`, `Contact`, and `Opportunity`
2. Read recent linked `Activities`, `Notes`, and open `Tasks`
3. Check `DASHBOARD.md`, `RELATIONSHIP_MEMORY.md`, and `INTELLIGENCE.md`
4. If relevant, inspect `crm-data/staging/` for pending Workspace proposals
5. Make the smallest coherent change that improves record quality and execution clarity

For structural work:

1. Read `docs/schema-spec.md`
2. Inspect the relevant templates in `templates/`
3. Inspect the write path in the relevant script
4. Update readers for backward compatibility before removing old fields
5. Prefer additive migrations, validate, then remove deprecated structures later

## Current Sharp Edges

- `Deal-Flow/` is still the live deal directory
- some scripts still tolerate older aliases and compatibility fields
- telemetry fields are still persisted in some records
- some skill docs may lag the latest schema cleanup and should be updated when touched
- Granola post-ingest depends on a working local Codex CLI session with Granola MCP configured
- the Granola pass is intentionally conservative about anchoring; unanchored meetings are skipped rather than guessed
- WhatsApp post-ingest depends on a working local `wacli` installation and readable local store state
- the WhatsApp pass is intentionally conservative and should be treated as staged evidence, not broad auto-capture

## Bottom Line

Your job in this repo is to maintain a trustworthy relationship memory system.

That means:
- canonical new writes
- tolerant readers
- careful migrations
- evidence-based updates
- minimal duplication
- relationship-first outputs
